## ‚≠ê Overall rating calculation
Attack and defense-oriented position players overall will be calculated as:
All stats sum / 5

Midfield and fullbacks will be calculated as:
All stats sum / 5.5

The thinking process is that attackers' defending stat is not too important for their overall. And that goes vice-versa to defenders' shooting for example.

Meanwhile, it's arguable that midfield and fullback players' stats are all important, however, according to simulation and comparison with other FIFA cards, analyzing players from 60 to 90 OVR, it wouldn't reflect well to divide all stats by 6, players with overall of 85 would get almost 10 points off.

On the other hand, good results were obtained by diving it by 5.5, the discrepancy was very small considering that this will be a very basic formula.

For now, on the MVP version, Goalkeepers will have only the overall attribute set.

This measure will be the one used for now.
